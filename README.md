# &#35; React Memory Game&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Description
This is a memorize and click game. The object of the game is to click on only one character once. If you repeat guesses, you lose and the score is reset to 0. The top score will continue to be updated as you try over again. You can try as many times as you'd like to get your high score even higher!
